This program exists to "solve" a very annoying problem. 

Windows 10 seems to soft-disable some audio devices after not receiving an audio stream to save power. This is sometimes accompanied by a click or pop and can be very annoying.  

In recording programs, this means that while there is no audio playing, the recording stops, so if you are expecting to have any timing with recording computer audio, it gets thrown out of the window.

This program is a simple solution to the problem: it loops a blank .wav file in the background while it runs.  It's annoying that this works as well as it does.

Silence2 runs in the sytem tray. To close it, just right click and click "Close."
